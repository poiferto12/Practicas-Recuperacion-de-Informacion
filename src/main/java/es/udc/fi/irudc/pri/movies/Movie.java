/*
 * Define a record class with the attributes we are going to use and set

 * rating column in the CSV
 *
 * Without the annotation we need to declare all attributes or parsing fails
 * because it finds unknown attributes.
 *
 * Use the annotation @JsonProperty to define the name of the field in the
 * source file if we want to have a different name for the attribute. This can
 * be because we want, for example, to use a different naming convention, but it
 * is necessary in case of field names that conflict with Java keywords, such as
 * class or abstract
